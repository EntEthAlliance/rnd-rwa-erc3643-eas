# Shibui

**An attestation retrieval adapter for ERC-3643 security tokens.** Shibui lets an ERC-3643 token answer *"is this wallet allowed to hold this security right now?"* from attestations issued on the [Ethereum Attestation Service](https://attest.org/) by any trusted KYC/AML/accreditation provider — without deploying a per-user identity contract or coupling the token to a single provider ecosystem.

> An open-source project by the [Enterprise Ethereum Alliance](https://entethalliance.org)

## Why Shibui exists

ERC-3643 (the security token standard) mandates an on-chain identity check on every transfer. The reference implementation (ONCHAINID) requires each investor to deploy their own identity contract, pins the token to a specific KYC-provider ecosystem, and offers no on-chain enforcement of the attestation's *contents* — only its existence.

That model breaks down for issuers who need any of:

- **Multiple KYC providers** for the same token (geographic, redundancy, or suitability).
- **Semantic enforcement** — blocking a wallet whose KYC is pending, expired, or whose jurisdiction is on a sanctions list.
- **An auditable control plane** where compliance staff, not engineers, can rotate trusted providers.
- **An evidence trail** that ties a verification decision back to the underlying KYC file a regulator will ask for.

Shibui addresses those needs by replacing the ONCHAINID identity layer with a small stack of contracts that read EAS attestations, enforce the payload against a configurable policy per topic, and gate trust changes with a cryptographic audit trail.

## What it does

Shibui's one public entry point is:

```solidity
EASClaimVerifier.isVerified(address wallet) → bool
```

For a transfer to be allowed, the ERC-3643 token contract calls this from its compliance hook. Shibui returns `true` only when, for **every** claim topic the token requires:

- The investor's identity has an EAS attestation registered for that topic, from an attester the issuer currently trusts for that topic.
- The attestation is live (not revoked, not past its EAS-level `expirationTime`, not past its payload-level `expirationTimestamp`).
- The attestation's decoded payload satisfies the topic's policy — e.g. `kycStatus == VERIFIED`, `countryCode` in the allow-list, `accreditationType` in the allowed set, `sanctionsStatus == CLEAR`.

If any required topic fails any check, `isVerified` returns `false` and the transfer is blocked by the token contract.

## What it does *not* do

Shibui is deliberately narrow. The following remain the responsibility of the ERC-3643 **token contract** or off-chain operational tooling:

| Primitive | Where it lives |
|---|---|
| Forced transfer (court orders) | ERC-3643 token |
| Freeze / partial freeze (sanctions) | ERC-3643 token |
| Lost-key recovery | ERC-3643 token `recoveryAddress` flow |
| Lock-ups, per-investor caps, ownership limits | ERC-3643 compliance modules |
| Cross-chain attestation canonicity | Per-chain today — re-attest per chain |
| Off-chain / privacy-preserving attestation verification | Not supported today |
| Tax withholding, FATCA / CRS reporting | Off-chain |

Revoking a Shibui attestation blocks *future* transfers to/from the wallet. It does not move, freeze, or recover tokens already held. See [`docs/architecture/enforcement-boundary.md`](docs/architecture/enforcement-boundary.md).

## Architecture

### Runtime wiring

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Wallet[Investor Wallet] -->|transfer| Token[ERC-3643 Token]
    Token -->|isVerified| Verifier[EASClaimVerifier]

    Verifier -->|resolve wallet→identity| Proxy[EASIdentityProxy]
    Verifier -->|required topics| CTR[ClaimTopicsRegistry]
    Verifier -->|attester list per topic| Adapter[EASTrustedIssuersAdapter]
    Verifier -->|fetch attestation| EAS[(EAS)]
    Verifier -->|validate payload| Policies[ITopicPolicy × 8]

    Adapter -.->|authUID → Schema 2| EAS
    EAS -.->|gate Schema-2 writes| Resolver[TrustedIssuerResolver]

    Admin[Compliance Multisig] -.->|AccessControl| Verifier
    Admin -.->|AccessControl| Adapter
    Admin -.->|AccessControl| Proxy
    Admin -.->|Ownable| Resolver
```

### Verification flow

For a single `isVerified(wallet)` call:

1. **Resolve the investor's identity.** `EASIdentityProxy.getIdentity(wallet)` returns the identity address. The proxy is required — there is no "wallet is its own identity" fallback.
2. **Enumerate required topics** from `ClaimTopicsRegistry.getClaimTopics()`.
3. **For each required topic**, the verifier:
   - Looks up the bound `ITopicPolicy` (e.g. `KYCStatusPolicy` for topic 1). No policy bound → verification reverts with `PolicyNotConfiguredForTopic`.
   - Looks up the bound EAS schema UID.
   - Iterates the topic's trusted-attester list (capped at 5). For each attester, fetches the registered attestation and checks: exists → schema matches → not revoked → not expired → attester still trusted → `policy.validate(attestation)` returns true.
   - Short-circuits to *pass* on the first attester whose attestation clears all checks.
4. **Returns true** only if every required topic was satisfied.

### Trust changes (Schema-2 gate)

Adding a trusted attester is a two-step, cryptographically signed process:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Admin as Compliance Multisig
    participant Resolver as TrustedIssuerResolver
    participant EAS as EAS
    participant Adapter as EASTrustedIssuersAdapter

    Admin->>Resolver: addAuthorizer(authorizer)
    Note right of Resolver: Resolver curates the<br/>set of Schema-2 writers

    Admin->>EAS: attest Schema 2<br/>(attester, topics, name)
    EAS->>Resolver: onAttest()
    Resolver-->>EAS: authorizer in set? → true
    EAS-->>Admin: authUID

    Admin->>Adapter: addTrustedAttester(attester, topics, authUID)
    Adapter->>EAS: getAttestation(authUID)
    EAS-->>Adapter: Schema 2 attestation
    Adapter->>Adapter: recipient == attester ✓<br/>topics ⊆ authorizedTopics ✓<br/>not revoked / not expired ✓
    Adapter-->>Admin: trust updated
```

Every trusted-attester change references a live EAS attestation under Schema 2 (Issuer Authorization). That attestation is gated by a resolver, so only admin-curated authorizers can write it. The result is an on-chain audit trail: "this provider is trusted for these topics, as attested on-chain by this authorized party at this block."

## Claim topics and policies

Each ERC-3643 claim topic is bound to exactly one policy module. All eight policies decode the same **Investor Eligibility v2** schema.

| Topic ID | Name | Policy | What it enforces |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | KYC | `KYCStatusPolicy` | `kycStatus == VERIFIED` |
| 2 | AML | `AMLPolicy` | `amlStatus == CLEAR` |
| 3 | COUNTRY | `CountryAllowListPolicy` | `countryCode` in allow-list (or not in block-list, configurable) |
| 7 | ACCREDITATION | `AccreditationPolicy` | `accreditationType` in admin-configured allowed set |
| 9 | PROFESSIONAL | `ProfessionalInvestorPolicy` | any non-zero accreditation type (MiFID II) |
| 10 | INSTITUTIONAL | `InstitutionalInvestorPolicy` | `accreditationType == INSTITUTIONAL` |
| 13 | SANCTIONS_CHECK | `SanctionsPolicy` | `sanctionsStatus == CLEAR` |
| 14 | SOURCE_OF_FUNDS | `SourceOfFundsPolicy` | `sourceOfFundsStatus == VERIFIED` |

Schema 1 v2:

```
address identity, uint8 kycStatus, uint8 amlStatus, uint8 sanctionsStatus,
uint8 sourceOfFundsStatus, uint8 accreditationType, uint16 countryCode,
uint64 expirationTimestamp, bytes32 evidenceHash, uint8 verificationMethod
```

`evidenceHash` commits to the KYC file the provider holds off-chain; `verificationMethod` captures whether the check was self-certified, third-party-reviewed, broker-dealer-file-backed, etc. Both support post-trade audit trails without putting PII on-chain.

## Administration

Three roles, gated by OpenZeppelin `AccessControl`:

| Role | Holder | Can do |
|---|---|---|
| `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` | **Compliance multisig** | Grant/revoke other roles; authorise UUPS upgrades; set the Issuer Authorization schema UID on the adapter. |
| `OPERATOR_ROLE` | Day-to-day operators | Map topics to schemas, bind topics to policies, add/remove/update trusted attesters. |
| `AGENT_ROLE` | Issuer agents | Bind wallets to investor identities in the identity proxy. |

The production deploy script grants all three to the multisig atomically and renounces the deployer's grants in the same transaction. No timelock — the multisig is the control plane.

## Two integration paths

**Path A — pluggable verifier (recommended).** The token's ERC-3643 compliance module calls `EASClaimVerifier.isVerified(wallet)` directly. This gives you payload-aware verification, multi-attester resiliency, and the full admin surface.

**Path B — read-compat shim.** `EASClaimVerifierIdentityWrapper` implements the `IIdentity` / ERC-735 interface backed by EAS attestations, for integrating with a pre-existing ERC-3643 Identity Registry that can't be modified. It is **not** a drop-in replacement for ONCHAINID:

- Does not implement ERC-734 key management (no `addKey`, no recovery).
- Does not return real attester signatures from `getClaim` (returns empty bytes).
- Does not run topic policies in `isClaimValid` (only checks existence / revocation / expiration).
- Gas profile is not suitable for hot paths without caching.

Use Path A for new deployments. Use Path B only if you genuinely cannot modify the Identity Registry, and understand the trade-offs.

## Quickstart

```bash
forge install
forge build
forge test
```

### Local pilot

```bash
anvil
forge script script/SetupPilot.s.sol:SetupPilot \
  --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 \
  --broadcast
```

Deploys MockEAS, the full Shibui stack (all 8 policies + resolver + Schema-2 authorizer), seeds five investors with Schema v2 attestations, and prints `isVerified()` for each.

### Testnet pipeline

```bash
# 1. Deploy contracts + policies + resolver
PRIVATE_KEY=... ADMIN_ADDRESS=0x... \
  forge script script/DeployTestnet.s.sol:DeployTestnet --rpc-url $RPC --broadcast

# 2. Register the two EAS schemas (prints UIDs)
PRIVATE_KEY=... ISSUER_AUTH_RESOLVER=<from step 1> \
  forge script script/RegisterSchemas.s.sol:RegisterSchemas --rpc-url $RPC --broadcast

# 3. Wire schema UIDs, topic-policy bindings, and Schema-2 UID on the adapter
VERIFIER_ADDRESS=... ADAPTER_ADDRESS=... \
INVESTOR_ELIGIBILITY_SCHEMA_UID=0x... \
ISSUER_AUTHORIZATION_SCHEMA_UID=0x... \
KYC_POLICY=0x... AML_POLICY=0x... COUNTRY_POLICY=0x... \
  forge script script/ConfigureBridge.s.sol:ConfigureBridge --rpc-url $RPC --broadcast

# 4. Authorize the authorizer(s) on the resolver, then create a Schema-2 attestation
#    for each KYC provider (off-chain or via cast/EAS SDK), then:
ADAPTER_ADDRESS=... ATTESTER_ADDRESS=0x... TOPICS="1,3,7" AUTH_UID=0x... \
  forge script script/AddTrustedAttester.s.sol:AddTrustedAttester --rpc-url $RPC --broadcast

# 5. Each KYC provider attests investors against the Investor Eligibility schema,
#    then the provider (or an AGENT_ROLE holder) registers the UID via
#    EASClaimVerifier.registerAttestation(identity, topic, uid).
```

### Mainnet

Gated behind `AUDIT_ACKNOWLEDGED=true`; requires an audited deploy and a compliance multisig:

```bash
AUDIT_ACKNOWLEDGED=true \
PRIVATE_KEY=... \
MULTISIG_ADDRESS=0x... \
CLAIM_TOPICS_REGISTRY=0x... \
  forge script script/DeployMainnet.s.sol:DeployMainnet --rpc-url $RPC --broadcast
```

The script transfers all admin roles to the multisig and renounces the deployer's grants in the same broadcast. See [`AUDIT.md`](AUDIT.md) for the launch gate and threat model.

## Gas at a glance

| Operation | Gas |
|---|---:|
| `isVerified` — 1 topic | 31,539 |
| `isVerified` — 3 topics | 80,083 |
| `isVerified` — 5 topics | 122,090 |
| `registerAttestation` | 53,393 |
| `addTrustedAttester` (Schema-2 gated) | 201,533 |
| `registerWallet` | 79,029 |

Full report and reproduction instructions in [`docs/gas-benchmarks.md`](docs/gas-benchmarks.md).

---

## Security

- Reproducible local tests: `forge test` (107 tests passing).
- Mainnet deploy is gated — the script refuses to broadcast unless `AUDIT_ACKNOWLEDGED=true` is set. See [`AUDIT.md`](AUDIT.md) for the launch gate, threat model, and minimum-required pre-flight checklist.
- Roles, not ownership. All admin actions are role-gated; production uses a compliance multisig as `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`.
